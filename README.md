## Background

Navigating large indoor complex spaces is often challenging due to complex layouts and the limitations of traditional aids like static maps, signs, and phone-based GPS. This Interior Navigation Challenge aims to address these issues and make indoor navigation more intuitive, personalized, and accessible.

## Challenge

**Make indoor navigation in complex spaces more intuitive, personalized, and accessible.**

---

## Context

By "interior navigation," we mean the art of finding your way in large, complex indoor spaces like shopping malls, airports, hospitals, or college campuses. Traditional tools like static maps and signs often need improvement. They should be more user-friendly, adaptable to individual needs, and provide real-time updates.

Here's your challenge: First, brainstorm scenarios where indoor navigation proves to be challenging. Consider a visitor struggling to locate a department on a labyrinthine college campus, someone frantically searching for a specific store in a vast shopping mall, or a traveler hustling through an airport to make a connecting flight.

Once you've identified the problem, it's time to get creative. By "innovative solutions," we mean a wide array of options, from web or mobile apps to AI integration or hardware implementations. You can also employ "design thinking," a problem-solving approach that involves deeply understanding the user's needs and creatively finding solutions that meet those needs. The goal is to make the indoor navigation experience more intuitive, personalized, and accessible for many users. There are no constraints on the technology or method you choose; the aim is to elevate the indoor navigation experience significantly.
